\section{Features and Use Cases}\label{sec:features_use-cases}
Several features and use cases has been identified in order to get an overview
of the co-simulation domain that Maestro is part of. The starting point for this
work is a survey of co-simulation~\cite{cosim-survey}. The identified features are
available in a rough feature model at \url{} and the identified use cases are available at \url{}.

It is an ongoing task to map use cases to features, and to map features to
language constructs and plugins.
As mentioned in the abstract, the Maestro team is very interested in features,
use cases and similar. Feedback can be provided via GitHub issues at the Maestro
repository \url{https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/maestrov2/issues} or via email to casper.thule@eng.au.dk.
